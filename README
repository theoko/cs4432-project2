Section I:
- Import the project (src folder) in an IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ)
- Copy the "Project2Dataset" directory (dataset) in the same directory as the project
- Setup SDK (I developed this using version 11)
- Run the main method in the Main.java file

The program will not terminate unless an invalid command is given or it is stopped.

Section II:
The tests in the "tests" file are all working.

Section III:
It is assumed, as per the assignment instructions, that there will not be a query that requests specific record fields other than all (*).
Also, it is assumed that the Project2Dataset will always be used. Please note that the query parsing implemented is not ideal because it only works for the commands
mentioned in the project requirements.
